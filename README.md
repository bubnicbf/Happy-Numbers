# Happy-Numbers
Finds and prints the first 8 happy numbers.

A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. 

####Example:
More formally, given a number $n=n_0$, define a sequence $n_1, n_2, ... where n_{i+1}$ is the sum of the squares of the digits of $n_i$. Then $n$ is happy if and only if there exists $i$ such that $n_i = 1$.

If a number is happy, then all members of its sequence are happy; if a number is unhappy, all members of the sequence are unhappy.

For example, 19 is happy, as the associated sequence is:

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1.

The 143 happy numbers up to 1,000 are:

1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 109, 129, 130, 133, 139, 167, 176, 188, 190, 192, 193, 203, 208, 219, 226, 230, 236, 239, 262, 263, 280, 291, 293, 301, 302, 310, 313, 319, 320, 326, 329, 331, 338, 356, 362, 365, 367, 368, 376, 379, 383, 386, 391, 392, 397, 404, 409, 440, 446, 464, 469, 478, 487, 490, 496, 536, 556, 563, 565, 566, 608, 617, 622, 623, 632, 635, 637, 638, 644, 649, 653, 655, 656, 665, 671, 673, 680, 683, 694, 700, 709, 716, 736, 739, 748, 761, 763, 784, 790, 793, 802, 806, 818, 820, 833, 836, 847, 860, 863, 874, 881, 888, 899, 901, 904, 907, 910, 912, 913, 921, 923, 931, 932, 937, 940, 946, 964, 970, 973, 989, 998, 1000
